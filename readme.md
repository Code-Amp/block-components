# Code Amp Block Components
> React components for the WordPress block editor.

*Inspired by the work in [10up/block-components](https://github.com/10up/block-components)*

## Install

Run `npm install @codeamp/block-components`

## Components

- [MultiSelectControl](https://github.com/Code-Amp/block-components/tree/main/components/multi-select-control)

  A multi-select control for the block editor based on `FormTokenField`.

- [ResourceSelectControl](https://github.com/Code-Amp/block-components/tree/main/components/resource-select-control)

## Usage

Use imports to include the components in your project.

## Project status

This package is currently published as beta while we continue to setup the repository and add testing, but should be completely usable.
