# Code Amp Block Components
> React components for the WordPress block editor.

*Inspired by the work in [10up/block-components](https://github.com/10up/block-components)*

## Install

Run `npm install @codeamp/block-components`

## Components

### [MultiselectControl](https://github.com/Code-Amp/block-components/tree/main/components/multiselect-control)

A multi-select control for the block editor based on `FormTokenField`.

### [ResourceSelectControl](https://github.com/Code-Amp/block-components/tree/main/components/resource-select-control)

A resource select control, allowing for the selection of a resource from a list of resources as well as additional actions (primary + secondary) to be performed on the resource.

## Usage

Use imports to include the components in your project.

```jsx
import { MultiselectControl, ResourceSelectControl } from '@codeamp/block-components';
```

The components are tree-shakeable, so you can import only the components you need.

## Project status

This package is currently published as beta while we continue to setup the repository and add testing, but should be completely usable.

Expect updates in the near future.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome, but at this early stage the priority is to setup testing and improve the documentation.
